Using Python and the popular Django framework, you’ll build a content aggregator from scratch.

Surfing through various websites to collate the best material for content is a tedious task. With this Python Project, searching and collating all the resources and materials in one place becomes a lot easier.

In this Project, you’ll learn:

RSS feeds: how to use them
How to create custom Django management commands
How to run your custom command when you specify a schedule
Testing your Django app’s functionality with unit tests
The major steps involved in this project are:

Create a list of sites from which you want to collect data.
Scrape these sites’ content using libraries like HTTP request sender and BeautifulSoup.
Apscheduler is used for background content management.
Scrapped content is stored in a database.

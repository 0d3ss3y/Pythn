A nightmare for a writer is whether or not the written work falls into plagiarism barriers. The plagiarism tool scans through your work to find an overlap from an existing source posted online. 

To avoid any overlap for stealing someone’s work, we tend to put our work through plagiarism checkers. But the tools cost a fortune. So, with this Python project, you can create a plagiarism checker to scour through any writing work. This Python project uses a Natural Language Processing tool along with a search API to prepare a full-fledged usable Plagiarism checker. 

What you will need:

TensorFlow is an extremely powerful library for building neural networks with a variety of parameters. A neural network consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer.
We will also need Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to prepare the dataset with our own texts for training the machine learning model. We must tokenize the root words from texts in order to train the machine learning model. 
Input will be a CSV file with only one ‘Text’ column. The file is named InterviewBit.csv. The text in each row of the column ‘Text’ will be different. You can make these texts as long as you want, as long as they do not contain commas or special symbols. For longer texts, the model will require more epochs to provide higher accuracy.  

You will be learning the following things while building this project:

the basic knowledge of neural networks
 stemming words
 Tokenization
 natural language processing
